# code-gen
Generate code from Pseudo code

Most of the times we write the same code we wrote some time back in the same programming language, the idea is to generate actual code from the pseudo code. 

This is just the placeholder and a very early version (and undocumented version) of a code-gen. Initial version with some documentation to come soon.
